This directory contains Python 3 scripts. To run:

* Install Python 3 (www.python.org)

* Double-click on the script. If you are asked how to open it, choose
  "Run in Terminal".

* If double-clicking doesn't work (e.g. if it opens the script in a text
  editor), open a terminal in this directory and then type "./" followed
  by the script name (e.g. "./card_cost_calculator.py").
