        <h2>Rulebook (11<sup>th</sup> Edition)</h2>

        <p>Keeper of the Cards is a trading card game, loosely inspired by elements from various popular trading card games you may be familiar with. The primary distinguishing factor of Keeper of the Cards, however, is that you don't just trade cards; you <em>create</em> cards.</p>

        <p>Unlike other trading card games, there are no official cards for Keeper of the Cards. Instead, there are official effect components that can be used for cards and official rules for calculating the cost of playing any given card. These rules are laid out separately in the <a href="cardbuilding.html">Card Building Guide</a>.</p>

        <p>This document, on the other hand, serves to explain the rules of the game.</p>

        <h3 id="cardtypes">Card Types and Layout</h3>
        <p>There are two types of cards in Keeper of the Cards: creatures, and spells. Here are some examples of both:</p>
        <img class="example" src="images/card_examples.png" alt="Visual of two cards (&ldquo;Velociraptor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mourning a Loss&rdquo;).">
        <p>The card on the left is a creature, and the card on the right is a spell. They are visually very similar; the only noteworthy difference is that spells have a pair of triangles instead of the additional elements found on a creature.</p>
        <p>The elements marked on the cards are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The name of the card. This is purely cosmetic and has no effect on the game.</li>
            <li>The card image. This is purely cosmetic and has no effect on the game.</li>
            <li>The ability text of the card.</li>
            <li>Edition Indicator indicating the edition of the game the card was designed for.</li>
            <li>The resource cost of the card.</li>
            <li>The flavor text of the card. This is purely cosmetic and has no effect on the game.</li>
            <li>The offensive power (&ldquo;offense&rdquo;) of the card.</li>
            <li>The defensive power (&ldquo;defense&rdquo;) of the card.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="setup">Setup and Deck Building</h3>
        <p>Prior to starting a game of Keeper of the Cards, you must assemble a deck and a reserves. The deck must contain 40&ndash;60 cards, while the reserves must contain exactly 10 cards. All cards must look the same from the back (this can be achieved by using sleeves if necessary). Other than that, there are no restrictions on what legal cards you can put in your deck.</p>
        <p>You can find preexisting sets of example cards, as well as instructions for how to print them, in the <a href="">Starter Set</a>.</p>
        <p>Before each game, shuffle your deck. Draw 5 cards from your deck; this will be your starting hand. You begin the game with 20 <abbr title="hitpoints">HP</abbr>, which you can note on a piece of paper or through some other counter.</p>
        <p>You should have a reasonable amount of six-sided dice (preferably at least 10&ndash;20 dice), and some objects such as coins or poker chips to use as counters. You must also determine who goes first. One suggested method is for each player to roll two six-sided dice and for the player with the highest roll to go first.</p>
        <p>Keeper of the Cards can be played by 2 or more players. There is theoretically no limit, but it is recommended to keep the number of players small, preferably between 2 and 8. In the case of a game with more than two players, each player works alone with their own HP and field.</p>

        <h3 id="field">The Field</h3>
        <p>Each player's field contains the following zones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deck: Typically to the right of your Trap Zone. The deck's contents are not revealed to anyone, and it is shuffled before the start of the game.</li>
            <li>Graveyard: Typically to the right of your Deck. Any card which is destroyed or sacrificed is immediately sent here, face-down. The contents of the graveyard are not public knowledge, but its owner may look through it at any time.</li>
            <li>Reserves: Typically to the left of your Trap Zone. Cards in your reserves are not used directly, but can be switched out with any card in your hand at any time during your Resource Phase.</li>
            <li>Creature Zone: Typically above your Trap Zone. Contains your &ldquo;in play&rdquo; creatures. The contents of this zone are public knowledge.  There is no limit to the number of cards that can be in your Creature Zone.</li>
            <li>Trap Zone: Typically to the left of your Deck. Contains your &ldquo;in play&rdquo; spells (a.k.a. &ldquo;traps&rdquo;). The contents of this zone are not public knowledge, but its owner may look at the cards within at any time.  There is no limit to the number of cards that can be in your Trap Zone.</li>
            <li>Resource Zone: Typically below your your Trap Zone. Contains your resources. The contents of this zone are not public knowledge, but its owner may look at the cards within at any time. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be in your Resource Zone. Note: Cards in this zone are not considered to be &ldquo;in play&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>Hand: The cards you currently have available to play, held in your hand. The contents of a hand are not public knowledge, but its owner may look at the cards within at any time. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be in your hand.</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="example" src="images/zones.png" alt="">

        <h3 id="turnorder">Turn Order</h3>
        <p>Each turn in Keeper of the Cards consists of the following phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Resource Phase: Place up to two cards from your hand, face-down, onto the Resource Zone, unexhausted. Then draw a number of cards equal to two minus the number of cards you placed into the Resource Zone. In other words, choose <strong>one</strong> of the following: <b>(a)</b> draw two cards (no resources placed); <b>(b)</b> place one resource and draw one card; or <b>(c)</b> place two resources (no cards drawn). See <a href="#resources">Resources, Exhaustion, and Recovery</a> for more information about resource placement.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Special exception</b>: on the first turn of the game, the starting player only either places one card onto the Resource Zone OR draws one card. They can still exchange cards in their hand with cards in their reserves as described in the next bullet point.</li>
                    <li>At any time during the Resource Phase, including before, after, or at the same time as any of the actions described above, you may exchange any number of cards in your hand for any of the same number of cards in your reserves. For example, if your reserves contains card A, which you want, and card B is in your hand, you can place card B into your reserves in order to place card A into your hand. You can do this as many times as you like before ending your Resource Phase.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Action Phase: You may play any cards from your hand that you are able to, and you may also activate in-play creature abilities and in-play traps with no activation condition. See <a href="#creatures">Creatures</a> and <a href="spells">Casting Spells and Setting Traps</a> for more information.</li>
            <li>Battle Phase: You may do battle with your unexhausted creatures. See <a href="#battles">Battles</a> for more information.</li>
            <li>Recovery Phase: Every card in play and every resource is unexhausted. Every creature in play has its offense and defense reset to the respective values printed on the card (reversing any damage or stat changes due to card abilities).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="resources">Resources, Exhaustion, and Recovery</h3>
        <p>Resources are used to summon creatures and cast spells. A resource can be any card. Resources are placed into the Resource Zone unexhausted (oriented vertically) during the Resource Phase (as explained above). When you place a resource into the Resource Zone, it is always played face-down, as its identity is not public knowledge.</p>
        <p>To pay a resource cost is to exhaust a number of unexhausted resources. For example, to pay a resource cost of 3, exhaust three of your currently unexhausted resources by turning them sideways.</p>
        <p><dfn>Exhausted</dfn>, for any card, means that the card cannot currently be used, and is marked by turning the card sideways. To unexhaust a card, return it to an upright orientation. This is done only during the Recovery Phase.</p>
        <p>During the Recovery Phase, all cards in every player's Creature Zone, Trap Zone, and Resource Zone are unexhausted. In addition, every creature in every player's Creature Zone has its offense and defense returned to the value printed on its card. This effectively reverses any stat changes that might have happened, including damage. As such, these stat changes effectively last only for the turn in which they take effect, even though this is not explicitly stated in card effects.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you control a creature with a printed offense of 3 and a printed defense of 10. You could cast a spell to increase its offense by 4, at which point its offense becomes 7. It could then take 8 damage during a battle with another creature (see <a href="#battles">Battles</a>), at which point its defense becomes 2. However, during the Recovery Phase, all of this creature's stats are reset to what is printed on its card, so its offense becomes 3 and its defense becomes 10.</p>

        <h3 id="creatures">Creatures</h3>
        <p>Creatures are used to do battle, but may also have special abilities.</p>
        <p>To summon a creature, pay a number of resources equal to the card's resource cost, and then place it, face-up and exhausted, into the Creature Zone. (See <a href="#resources">Resources, Exhaustion, and Recovery</a> for more information about resources and exhaustion.)</p>
        <p>Some creatures have <dfn>caveats</dfn>, special rules which apply to them. Caveats are always on the first paragraph of the ability text. Most caveats make use of special keywords; see <a href="#keywords">Keywords</a> for a list of explanations for all of these keywords.</p>
        <p>Caveats may include such things as extra costs for summoning the creature, costs for attacking or defending, and restrictions on what the creature can do. Creatures with caveats that create requirements for summoning include a silhouette of a padlock behind the ability text (demonstrated by &ldquo;Mourning a Loss&rdquo; under <a href="cardtypes">Card Types and Layout</a>). Such caveats are also conventionally colored red to make them stand out from the rest of the text.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that costs defined by caveats must be paid from your own assets and zones unless the caveat text explicitly says otherwise. For example, if a summon cost calls for destroying two in-play cards, that exclusively means <em>your</em> resources even though the text does not say this explicitly. Additionally, any payment for a cost defined by a caveat must result in a corresponding real change of game state, e.g. you cannot declare that you are exhausting a creature which is already exhausted.</p>
        <p>Creatures can activate abilities, hold counters, and participate in battles, as described in the following subsections.</p>

        <h4 id="abilities">Creature Abilities</h4>
        <p>A creature's abilities are indicated in the ability text (after the caveat, if any), one paragraph for each ability. A creature ability may be given a name, designated in all caps at the beginning of the respective ability paragraph, followed by a colon. You can activate an ability of an unexhausted creature by exhausting it. Note: you can only activate one ability at a time.</p>
        <p>Some abilities have an <dfn>activation condition</dfn> indicating when to activate the ability. Activation conditions are followed by a colon (:) and appear at the very start of an ability's text. If an ability has an activation condition, you may only use the ability when the activation condition says. If an ability has no explicit activation condition, you may only use it during your own Action Phase. These rules apply to the abilities of spells as well.</p>
        <p>Some abilities also have an <dfn>activation cost</dfn>, which is a special cost (such as removing a certain number of counters or sacrificing one of your cards) that you must pay upon activation of the ability. Activation costs are followed by a semicolon (;) and appear toward the start of an ability's text. If you activate an ability you are unable to fully pay the activation cost for, the effect of the ability disappears.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that activation costs must be paid from your own resources and zones unless the activation cost text explicitly says otherwise. For example, if an activation cost calls for destroying two in-play cards, that exclusively means <em>your</em> resources even though the text does not say this explicitly. Additionally, any payment for an activation cost must result in a corresponding real change of game state, e.g. you cannot declare that you are exhausting a creature which is already exhausted.</p>
        <p>Many abilities make use of special keywords; see <a href="#keywords">Keywords</a> for a list of explanations for all of these keywords.</p>

        <h4 id="counters">Counters</h4>
        <p>Some abilities manipulate or utilize counters. A counter is a special marker which can be placed on an in-play creature (but not a trap or resource; if an effect places a counter on one of these types of card, that part of the effect is ignored). Any available object can be used as a counter. Counters stay on the creature they are placed on until either the creature leaves the Creature Zone, or an ability removes them.</p>
        <p>The simplest counters are unnamed counters. On their own, unnamed counters have no effect. These are typically removed from creatures as activation costs, enabling more powerful effects, or simply required for targeting. No player is permitted to remove unnamed counters from any card unless an ability does so.</p>
        <p>However, some abilities can also place special named counters, which in addition to being usable as normal counters, can be voluntarily removed to trigger special effects. The following rules apply to all named counters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>These counters can be removed (and their effects triggered) literally at any time, that is to say, during any phase of any player's turn, even immediately after placing them, triggering the stated effect.</li>
            <li>Removing counters for their effects does <strong>not</strong> require exhausting the creature it is on since the effect is that of the counter, not of the creature.</li>
            <li>The player who placed a counter is considered to be the counter’s &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and is the one who can remove it for its effect, regardless of who controls the creature. For example, if you place one of these counters on an opponent's creature, it is you who can then remove the counters to trigger the effect, and the opponent cannot do so. Note that this restriction only applies to the effect of the counter itself; there is no restriction on how any counter, including a counter with an effect, can be removed for an activation cost or by a card effect.</li>
            <li>For timing purposes, note that when an opponent activates an ability, that ability’s activation cost is paid and its target is selected immediately, meaning that e.g. you cannot remove counters for an effect to render an activation cost impossible unless you do so before the opponent indicates their intention to activate the respective ability. As such, to avoid conflict, if you intend to prevent an opponent from using an ability by removing a named counter during the Resource Phase, you should announce this intention prior to the start of that turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following is a list of named counters which are currently available, and an explanation of each one’s special effect (activated by removing the counter). Note that &ldquo;the card&rdquo; refers here to the card that the counter was removed from.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><dfn>Offense Counter</dfn>: Increase the card’s offense by 1.</li>
            <li><dfn>Defense Counter</dfn>: Increase the card’s defense by 5.</li>
            <li><dfn>Weakness Counter</dfn>: Decrease the card’s offense by 1.</li>
            <li><dfn>Damage Counter</dfn>: Roll a six-sided die and inflict damage to the card equal to the result.</li>
            <li><dfn>Exhaustion Counter</dfn>: Exhaust the card.</li>
            <li><dfn>Dice Counter</dfn>: Re-roll any one die (no matter who rolled the die initially).</li>
            <li><dfn>Immortality Counter</dfn>: Prevent the card from being destroyed or moved to another zone (Resource Zone, hand, Deck, or Graveyard) by an effect that would explicitly do so.
                <ul>
                    <li>This refers the effect portion of an ability only; it does not include costs of abilities that may destroy a card or move it to another zone. It also does not include destruction as a result of damage even if that damage was inflicted by an effect.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="battles">Battles</h4>
        <p>To battle, go through the following steps (only during the attacking player's Battle Phase):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The attacking player exhausts any number of their unexhausted creatures, which become the attacking team, and declares one target: a player, or a creature. Note: any given player or creature can only be targeted once per battle phase. The attacking player selects and announces the defending order of the attacking team (the order in which these creatures will be damaged).</li>
            <li>The target player, or the owner of the target creature, may exhaust any number of their own unexhausted creatures (which may or may not include the target itself), which become the defending team. If they do this, they then select and announce the defending order of the defending team (the order in which these creatures will be damaged).</li>
            <li>The attacking player rolls a number of six-sided dice equal to the total offense of the attacking team, and the defending player rolls a number of six-sided dice equal to the total offense of the defending team.</li>
            <li>Each player must take each of their dice, one at a time (in any order), and inflict the result as damage to the next surviving creature in the other player's team (based on the respective defending order selected) until either all dice are used or all creatures in the respective team are destroyed.</li>
            <li>If the target and any of the attacking team's dice remain, inflict the total result of these remaining dice as damage to the target.</li>
            <li>If the target was a player and any of the defending team's dice remain, inflict the total result of these remaining dice as damage to the attacking player.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the purposes of timing, steps 4&en;6 are considered to happen simultaneously. This can matter for the timing of certain cards, and it also means that if both players' HP reach zero during a battle, both players will lose simultaneously.</p>
        <p>To inflict damage to a creature, subtract the damage amount from the creature's defense, and then if the defense is less than or equal to zero, destroy the creature. For example, if 8 damage is inflicted to a creature with 15 defense, that creature will have 7 defense left and not be destroyed. If 8 damage is inflicted to a creature with 8 defense, however, that creature will have 0 defense left and be destroyed. Note that it is possible for creatures to have 0 defense; in such a case, any amount of damage will destroy the creature.</p>
        <p>As an example, consider an attacking team with two creatures (Creature A and Creature B) that each have 2 offense and 5 defense plus one creature (Creature C) that has 2 offense and 10 defense, targeting a player. The attacking player declares that they are attacking the defending player, and declares their defending order as &ldquo;Creature C → Creature A → Creature B&rdquo;. The defending player then chooses to defend with two creatures (Creature D and Creature E) that each have 1 offense and 10 defense, and declares their defending order as &ldquo;Creature D → Creature E&rdquo;. The attacking player rolls 6 dice, and the defending player rolls 2 dice. Suppose the attacking player rolls the following numbers: one, six, five, five, three, six; while the defending player rolls the following numbers: six, two. The defending player applies both the six and the two to the first attacking creature (Creature C), reducing its defense to 2; it survives. The attacking player chooses to apply a six, a three, and the one to the first creature (Creature D), reducing its defense to 0 and destroying it; then apply the two fives to the second creature (Creature E), reducing its defense to 0 and destroying it. Since all of the defending team's creatures have been destroyed and one die is left over, the remaining die (the other six) is applied as damage to the target (in this case, the defending player), so the defending player loses 6 HP.</p>
        <p>During your battle phase, you may initiate as many battles as you want to as long as you have unexhausted creatures remaining; however, you may not select the same target more than once in the same battle phase. For example, you cannot attack a player with one creature and then attack that same player with another creature within the same battle phase. However, you can use one creature to attack one of a player's creatures and then use a different creature to attack the owner of that creature, for example.</p>

        <h3 id="spells">Casting Spells and Setting Traps</h3>
        <p>Spells are cards that only have a single ability (shown in the card's ability text in the same manner that a creature ability is; see <a href="#abilities">Creature Abilities</a> for more information). Spells can be used in two ways: they can be cast from your hand, and they can be set as traps for use later.</p>
        <p>To cast a spell, pay a number of resources equal to the card's resource cost, reveal the spell to all other players, follow the instructions on the card immediately, and send the spell to the graveyard. Note: a spell cast this way is <strong>not</strong> considered to be &ldquo;in play&rdquo; at any stage. Just like with creature abilities, a spell with an activation condition can only be cast (either from the hand or as a trap) at the time that the activation condition says, and a spell with no activation condition can only be cast during your own action phase. Spells with activation conditions include a silhouette of a padlock behind the ability text (demonstrated by &ldquo;Mourning a Loss&rdquo; in <a href="#cardtypes">Card Types and Layout</a>). Spell activation conditions are also conventionally colored red to make them stand out from the rest of the text.</p>
        <p>Traps function the same way as spells, but the resource cost of a trap is paid when the trap is set and not when it is activated. Additionally, set traps are considered to be &ldquo;in play&rdquo; and can therefore be affected in ways similar to creatures by certain card effects, though it is important to note that unlike creatures, traps cannot be damaged, cannot be attacked, and cannot engage in battle.</p>
        <p>To set a trap, pay a number of resources equal to the card's resource cost (note: you do <strong>not</strong> reveal the trap), then place the card into the Trap Zone, face-down and exhausted. Note: the identity of the card is not public knowledge.</p>
        <p>To activate a trap, it must be unexhausted. Note that activating a trap does not incur any additional resource cost. Simply turn the trap over to reveal it to all other players (note: at this point, the trap is no longer &ldquo;in play&rdquo;), follow the instructions on the card, and then send it to the graveyard.</p>

        <h3 id="winning">Winning and Losing</h3>
        <p>Any given player can lose in one of three ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>By having their HP reduced to zero.</li>
            <li>By having an empty deck.</li>
            <li>By voluntarily forfeiting.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any player who loses is out of the game and can no longer affect the game in any way. When only one player remains in the game, that player is declared the winner. If all remaining players are eliminated at once (e.g. if all remaining players have their HP reduced to zero at the same time, or by all drawing their last card at the same time), the game ends in a draw.</p>

        <h3 id="keywords">Keywords</h3>
        <p>This section lists common keywords used in card text to keep it shorter and explains particular rulings related to them.</p>

        <h4>Action Cost</h4>
        <p>An <dfn>action cost</dfn> is a caveat indicating a cost that must be paid to attack with, defend with, or use an ability of the creature, in addition to the usual requirement to exhaust the creature.</p>

        <h4>Batch Add</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>batch add</dfn> is to add a total amount to the indicated stat of the targets, distributed among them. For example, if an effect tells you to batch add 5 offense to three targets, you might give 1 offense to the first target, 1 to the second target, and 3 to the third target.</p>

        <h4>Batch Subtract</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>batch subtract</dfn> is to subtract a total amount from the indicated stat of the targets, distributed among them. For example, if an effect tells you to batch subtract 7 offense from two targets, you might subtract 2 offense from the first target and subtract 5 offense from the second target.</p>
        <p>You are not allowed to reduce a creature's offense or defense stats below 0. For example, if an effect tells you to batch subtract 3 offense from two targets, where the first target has 1 offense and the second target has 5 offense, you can only subtract 1 from the first target, meaning the second target must lose at least 2 offense.</p>

        <h4>Counter</h4>
        <p>See <a href="#counters">Counters</a> for an explanation of what counters are and how they work, including a list of special named counters.</p>

        <h4>Deck-stack</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>deck-stack</dfn> a card is to place it on top of its owner's deck. When deck-stacking multiple cards, you can place them on top of their respective owners' decks in any order.</p>

        <h4>Destroy</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>destroy</dfn> a card is to cause it to be sent to the graveyard, just as if defeated by battle. This can be used to trigger effects which activate on destruction of a card.</p>

        <h4>Dice-burn</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>dice-burn</dfn> a player is to roll the indicated number of six-sided dice and reduce their HP by the total indicated on the dice. For example, to 2-dice-burn a player, roll two six-sided dice; if the results of the dice are 6 and 1, the player loses 7 HP.</p>
        <p>Dice-burn effects which affect both the player using the effect and another player may lead to both players' HP reaching zero at the same time. In this case, if these two players are the last players in the game, the game ends in a draw.</p>

        <h4>Dice-damage</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>dice-damage</dfn> a set of targets is to roll the indicated number of six-sided dice and inflict damage to targeted in-play creatures utilizing the results of the dice (as if in a battle). Each die can be used to damage any targeted in-play creature, and the decision of which die to use is made after rolling all of the dice.</p>

        <h4>Dice-heal</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>dice-heal</dfn> a player is to roll the indicated number of six-sided dice and increase their HP by the total indicated on the dice. For example, to 3-dice-heal a player, roll three six-sided dice; if the results of the dice are 4, 1, and 3, the player gains 8 HP.</p>

        <h4>Each</h4>
        <p>When the term <dfn>each</dfn> is used to refer to targets, it means that each target is affected separately, e.g. any decision required by the effect is made for each card separately (and thus can differ between them).</p>

        <h4>Enemy's Choice</h4>
        <p><dfn>Enemy's choice</dfn> indicates that cards which are being targeted or used as a cost are selected by any one opponent of your choice. For example, if a creature has a Summon Cost listed as, &ldquo;Exhaust 2 creatures (enemy's choice),&rdquo; the chosen opponent decides which two creatures you will be exhausting.</p>
        <p>In some target selections, the number of possible targets can be variable. In these cases, the chosen opponent does not choose the number; rather, you choose the number, and the chosen opponent selects exactly that number of targets.</p>
        <p>If an enemy's choice selection is of cards in the deck, graveyard, or hand, the chosen opponent (and no other player) gets to see all applicable choices. If the selection is of in-play cards or resources, however, the chosen opponent does not gain access to any new non-public knowledge and their selection must be informed by the information already available to them.</p>

        <h4>Excavate</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>excavate</dfn> cards is to pick them up from the top of your deck for the purpose of collecting a group of them from the top to be targeted by a target selection. The excavated cards are still considered to be within the deck in their original positions.</p>
        <p>You must excavate only the exact number of cards indicated. If your deck currently has fewer cards than the number of cards the ability instructs you to excavate, no cards are excavated; thus, the ability in question cannot continue and has no further effect.</p>
        <p>You may not look at the excavated cards unless the card text says you can. However, if the excavated cards are used for an enemy's choice selection, the chosen opponent gets to see the excavated cards.</p>

        <h4>Exhaust</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>exhaust</dfn> a card means to turn it sideways. Conversely, to <dfn>unexhaust</dfn> a card means to turn it upright. Only in-play cards and resources can be exhausted.</p>

        <h4>Hypnotize</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>hypnotize</dfn> a card means to change control of the target to a different player. For example, you could hypnotize an opponent's creature so that you control the creature instead.</p>
        <p>Only in-play creatures can be hypnotized.</p>

        <h4>In-play</h4>
        <p>The term <dfn>in-play</dfn> refers exclusively to non-destroyed creatures in the Creature Zone, and unactivated traps. Creatures cease being in-play the moment they are destroyed, sacrificed, or otherwise moved to any location other than the Creature Zone. Traps cease being in-play the moment they are destroyed, activated, or otherwise moved to any location other than the Trap Zone.</p>
        <p>Resources are never considered to be in-play under any circumstance. Additionally, spells activated from the Hand are not considered to be in-play at any point.</p>

        <h4>Owner</h4>
        <p>The <dfn>owner</dfn> of a card is always the player whose deck it originates from, regardless of who currently controls it.</p>

        <h4>Reckless Fighter</h4>
        <p><dfn>Reckless Fighter</dfn> is a caveat which causes the creature to be destroyed if it is unexhausted at the end of your own Battle Phase. In other words, you must attack with, use an ability of, or otherwise exhaust the creature every turn to keep it on the field.</p>

        <h4>Reveal</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>reveal</dfn> a card is to show it to all players, including yourself.</p>

        <h4>Sacrifice</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>sacrifice</dfn> a card is to send one of your cards to the graveyard as a cost. Sacrificed cards are not considered to be "destroyed" and thus do not trigger effects which activate on destruction of a card.</p>

        <h4>See</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>see</dfn> a card means to learn what the card is, without showing any other player. For example, if an effect has you see a card in an opponent's hand, you are allowed to see what the card is, but other players are not.</p>

        <h4>Silo</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>silo</dfn> a card means to place it into its owner's Resource Zone, exhausted. As with placing resources normally, siloed cards are placed onto the Resource Zone face-down.</p>

        <h4>Summon Cost</h4>
        <p>A <dfn>summon cost</dfn> is a caveat indicating an additional cost that must be paid to summon the creature in addition to exhausting resources as normal.</p>

        <h4>Target</h4>
        <p>Used as a verb, the <dfn>target</dfn> instructs on how to select the target(s) of an ability. Used as a noun, <dfn>target(s)</dfn> refers to all cards which have been selected by the aforementioned target selection text. (All targeted cards remain targeted throughout execution of the ability, regardless of where they are. For example, while it wouldn't make much sense, it would be entirely possible and allowed for an ability to summon a creature and then destroy that same creature, even though the creature's location changed when it was summoned.)</p>

        <h4>Deploy</h4>
        <p>To <dfn>deploy</dfn> a card means to play it as if it was in your hand. In other words, it means to do one of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Summon the card (if it is a creature).</li>
            <li>Cast the card (if it is a spell).</li>
            <li>Set the card as a trap (if it is a spell).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Just as when playing the card normally, you must pay all usual costs, including any applicable summon costs for creatures and activation costs for spells, and any creature summoned or trap set is placed onto the Creature Zone or Trap Zone exhausted.</p>
        <p>Cards which are already in-play cannot be deployed and thus are excluded.</p>

        <h4>Your</h4>
        <p>A card is considered to be <dfn>yours</dfn> if it is in any zone you control, regardless of who the owner of the card is. So for example, if you use an effect to summon an opponent’s creature, the owner of that creature is still your opponent (and therefore it gets sent to that player’s graveyard when destroyed, for example); but while it remains in your creature zone, it is &ldquo;your&rdquo; in-play creature and you can use it the same way as cards that came from your own deck.</p>

        <h3 id="revised">Revised Ability Text</h3>
        <p>This section lists old ability text portions which have been revised in a way that changes their meaning.

        <h3 id="redacted">Redacted Ability Text (Banned Cards)</h3>
        <p>This section lists ability texts which have been redacted. This is generally because the text results in cards that are too powerful or create a bad game experience. Any card with any of these texts is considered to be banned, i.e. may not be used in a game. Note: <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> are replaced with numbers in cards.</p>

        <h3 id="costs">Revised Costs</h3>
        <p>This section lists ability texts whose costs have been revised, and the edition in which such revision occurred. Any card bearing any of these texts <strong>must</strong> bear an Edition Indicator (see <a href="#cardtypes">Card Types and Layout</a>), which <strong>must</strong> indicate an edition number no less than the cost revision edition for the respective text(s). For instance, if a text cost was revised as of 10<sup>th</sup>  Edition, then cards indicated as 10<sup>th</sup> Edition, 11<sup>th</sup> Edition, etc are allowed, but cards indicated as 9<sup>th</sup> Edition, or whose edition is not indicated, are banned. Note: <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> are replaced with numbers in cards.</p>
        <p>To aid with identifying texts with revised costs, this section lists them in the form they were in immediately prior to being changed, rather than in their current form.</p>
