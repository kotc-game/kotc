Want to contribute to Keeper of the Cards? Awesome!

Of course, the first thing you could do is simply to play the game, introduce it to others, and make your own cool cards. The more the merrier, as they say! More players makes the game more and more interesting, especially given the nature of the game.

If you want to go further, example card contributions are absolutely welcome. We can add any card as an example card, as long as it fulfills the following conditions:

1. It must not be a banned card (see the rulebook).
2. It must not break any U.S. laws (in particular, copyright law and trademark law).
3. It must not pornographic in nature.
4. It must carry a libre/open content license.

Recommended licenses are the [Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (CC BY-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and the [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication tool (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Creative Commons also supplies logos for each license, so the way we recommend licensing a card is simply to embed the appropriate license logo into the card image; the small text below the image, by default, clarifies that any such license indicates the license of the entire card. The images can be found on their [Downloads page](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads/).

If you are not the copyright owner of the entire card (e.g. because the image was made by someone else, or because it uses a copyrighted work in a manner that is fair use), please alter the text below the image to properly indicate all authors and licenses as required by U.S. copyright law.

We do not accept the GNU GPL or the GNU FDL for example cards; these licenses require inclusion of the full text of the license for copying and redistribution, which would mean that a card under one of these licenses would require a supplimentary page if you print it and then give it to someone else. This is a burden for professional card printing services and a waste of paper.

Please also note that the lack of a copyright notice on an image **does not** mean that the image is in the public domain. By international convention, all works "fixed in a tangible medium" are automatically placed under copyright. A work only enters the public domain if its copyright expires, or if its author explicitly dedicates it to the public domain. As such, most images found on the Internet are *not* in the public domain. A good place to find actual public domain images, as well as images under other libre/open content licensing terms, is the Wikimedia Commons.

In any case, if you would like to contribute, you can either use Git (if you know how to use it), or you can open an issue; either works fine.
