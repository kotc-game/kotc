        <h3 id="velociraptor">Minion: Velociraptor</h3>
        <img class="example" src="images/build-examples/velociraptor.png" alt="Velociraptor: level 4 minion with 2 SP, 10 HP, and no abilities.">
        <p>This is a simple minion with no abilities. The following steps recreate this minion:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the minion's level set to 0.</li>
            <li>Choose the minion's SP. You can choose any number. In this case, we choose 2.</li>
            <li>Add the minion's SP to its level, bringing it to 2.</li>
            <li>Choose the minion's HP. You can choose any number, but a multiple of 5 is recommended. In this case, we choose 10.</li>
            <li>Take the minion's HP and divide it by 5. Add the result (2 in this case) to the minion's level, bringing it to 4.</li>
            <li>The minion's final level in this example is 4.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="antibiotic">Spell: Antibiotic</h3>
        <img class="example" src="images/build-examples/antibiotic.png" alt="Antibiotic: level 2 spell with ability: &ldquo;2-dice-heal yourself.&rdquo;">
        <p>This is an example of the simplest possible spell, composed only of a single effect. The following steps recreate this spell:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the spell's level set to 0.</li>
            <li>Choose the effect you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#effects">Card Building Guide: Effects</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;<var>x</var>-dice-heal yourself.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the effect has a variable <var>x</var>, replace that variable with a number. In this case, we choose the number 2. This gives us: &ldquo;2-dice-heal yourself.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Check the effect's level increase formula. In this case, the formula is
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mi>x</mi>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Replace the variable <var>x</var> in this formula with the number chosen in the previous step; in this case, 2. Since the formula is only a simple variable, we add the number (2) to the spell's level.
            </li>
            <li>Since the spell has no target selection, the sub-ability text is just the effect text. Since the spell has no activation condition and no activation cost, the ability text is just the sub-ability text. This gives us: &ldquo;2-dice-heal yourself.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>The spell's final level in this example is 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="asteroid">Spell: Asteroid Impact</h3>
        <img class="example" src="images/build-examples/asteroid_impact.png" alt="Asteroid Impact: level 8 spell with ability: &ldquo;Target up to 4 in-play cards; destroy the targets.&rdquo;">
        <p>This spell is slightly more complex than Antibiotic, but still fairly simple, composed of a single target selection and a single effect. The following steps recreate this spell:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the spell's level set to 0.</li>
            <li>Choose the effect you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#effects">Card Building Guide: Effects</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;destroy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the chosen effect does something with targets, we must include a target selection for this to do anything. Choose the target selection you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#targeting">Card Building Guide: Target Selections</a>. In this case, we choose, &ldquo;Target up to <var>x</var> in-play cards;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the target selection has a variable <var>x</var>, replace that variable with a number. In this case, we choose the number 4. This gives us: &ldquo;Target up to 4 in-play cards;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Check the target selection's formula for the variable <var>t</var>. In this case, the formula is
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mi>t</mi>
                        <mo>=</mo>
                        <mi>x</mi>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Replace the variable <var>x</var> in this formula with the number chosen in the previous step; in this case, 4. Doing so, we get
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mi>t</mi>
                        <mo>=</mo>
                        <mn>4</mn>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Therefore, the variable <var>t</var> is set to 4.
            </li>
            <li>Check the effect's level increase formula. In this case, the formula is
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mn>2</mn>
                        <mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>
                        <mi>t</mi>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Replace the variable <var>t</var> in this formula with the number calculated in the previous step; in this case, 4. Doing so, we get
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mn>2</mn>
                        <mo>Ã—</mo>
                        <mn>4</mn>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                We can now solve the level increase formula; doing so, we get 8 and therefore add 8 to the spell's level, bringing it to 8.
            </li>
            <li>The spell's sub-ability text is the target selection followed by the effect.  In this case, we get: &ldquo;Target up to 4 in-play cards; destroy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the spell has no activation conditions and no activation costs, the ability text is just the sub-ability text. This gives us: &ldquo;Target up to 4 in-play cards; destroy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>The spell's final level in this example is 8.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="thunderstrike">Spell: Thunderstrike</h3>
        <img class="example" src="images/build-examples/thunderstrike.png" alt="Thunderstrike: level 2 spell with ability: &ldquo;Target 1 in-play card; destroy it.&rdquo;">
        <p>This lower-level spell is made in almost exactly the same way as Asteroid Impact. The following steps recreate it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the spell's level set to 0.</li>
            <li>Choose the effect you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#effects">Card Building Guide: Effects</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;destroy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the chosen effect does something with targets, we must include a target selection for this to do anything. Choose the target selection you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#targeting">Card Building Guide: Target Selections</a>. In this case, we choose, &ldquo;Target up to <var>x</var> in-play cards;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the target selection has a variable <var>x</var>, replace that variable with a number. In this case, we choose the number 1. This gives us: &ldquo;Target up to 1 in-play cards;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Check the target selection's formula for the variable <var>t</var>. In this case, the formula is
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mi>t</mi>
                        <mo>=</mo>
                        <mi>x</mi>
                    </mrow>
                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Replace the variable <var>x</var> in this formula with the number chosen in the previous step; in this case, 1. Doing so, we get
                <math display="inline">
                    <mrow>
                        <mi>t</mi>

                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Therefore, the variable <var>t</var> is set to 1.
            </li>
            <li>Check the effect's level increase formula. In this case, the formula is

                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                Replace the variable <var>t</var> in this formula with the number calculated in the previous step; in this case, 1. Doing so, we get
                <math display="inline">

                    <mtext>.</mtext>
                </math>
                We can now solve the formula; doing so, we get 2 and therefore add 2 to the spell's level, bringing it to 2.
            </li>
            <li>The spell's sub-ability text is the target selection followed by the effect. In this case, we get: &ldquo;Target up to 1 in-play cards; destroy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since only 1 in-play card can be targeted, following the card building guide's recommendations, we remove the words "up to" and change the plural &ldquo;cards&rdquo; to the singular &ldquo;card&rdquo; in the target selection, and we change the plural &ldquo;the targets&rdquo; in the effect to the singular &ldquo;it&rdquo;. This gives us: &ldquo;Target 1 in-play card; destroy it.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the spell has no activation conditions and no activation costs, the ability text is just the sub-ability text. This gives us: &ldquo;Target 1 in-play card; destroy it.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>The spell's final level in this example is 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="thor">Minion: Thor</h3>
        <img class="example" src="images/build-examples/thor.png" alt="Thor: level 9 minion with 3 SP, 20 HP, and a single ability titled &ldquo;THOR'S HAMMER&rdquo;: &ldquo;When this card attacks, after Attack Formation (ghost-play): Target 1 in-play card; destroy it.&rdquo;">
        <p>This minion has an ability which is almost identical to the Thunderstrike spell, but includes an activation condition as well. The following steps recreate this minion:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the minion's level set to 0.</li>
            <li>Choose the minion's SP. You can choose any number. In this case, we choose 3.</li>
            <li>Add the minion's SP to its level, bringing it to 3.</li>
            <li>Choose the minion's HP. You can choose any number, but a multiple of 5 is recommended. In this case, we choose 20.</li>
            <li>Take the minion's HP and divide it by 5. Add the result (4 in this case) to the minion's level, bringing it to 7.</li>
            <li>Choose a name for the minion's ability. It can be anything you want, but must be in all capital letters. In this case, we choose &ldquo;THOR'S HAMMER&rdquo;. Its level starts at 0.</li>
            <li>In this case, we want to include an activation condition in THOR'S HAMMER. Select the desired activation condition from <a href="cardbuilding.html#conditions">Card Building Guide: Activation Conditions</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;When this card attacks, after Attack Formation (ghost-play):&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Choose the effect you want for THOR'S HAMMER's sub-ability from <a href="cardbuilding.html#effects">Card Building Guide: Effects</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;destroy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the chosen effect does something with targets, we must include a target selection for this to do anything. Choose the target selection you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#targeting">Card Building Guide: Target Selections</a>. In this case, we choose, &ldquo;Target up to <var>x</var> in-play cards;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the target selection has a variable <var>x</var>, replace that variable with a number. In this case, we choose the number 1. This gives us: &ldquo;Target up to 1 in-play cards;&rdquo;</li>

This gives us: &ldquo;Target 1 in-play card; destroy it.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>THOR'S HAMMER's ability text is its name (&ldquo;THOR'S HAMMER&rdquo;), followed by a colon, followed by its activation condition, followed by its sub-ability text.

            <li>Choose the effect you want for NECROMANCY's sub-ability from <a href="cardbuilding.html#effects">Card Building Guide: Effects</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;reveal and deploy the targets.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the chosen effect does something with targets, we must include a target selection for this to do anything. Choose the target selection you want from <a href="cardbuilding.html#targeting">Card Building Guide: Target Selections</a>. In this case, we choose: &ldquo;Target up to <var>x</var> cards in any graveyard randomly;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Since the target selection has a variable <var>x</var>, replace that variable with a number. In this case, we choose the number 3. This gives us: &ldquo;Target up to 3 cards in any graveyard randomly;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Check the target selection's formula for the variable <var>t</var>. In this case, the formula is
                <math display="inline">

                Replace the variable <var>x</var> in this formula with the number chosen in the previous step; in this case, 3. Doing so, we get

            <li>In this case, we want to include an activation condition in DYING CURSE. Select the desired activation condition from <a href="cardbuilding.html#conditions">Card Building Guide: Activation Conditions</a>. In this case, it's: &ldquo;When this in-play card is destroyed (ghost-play):&rdquo;</li>
