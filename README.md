# About Keeper of the Cards

We've always been a big fan of trading card games. Being able to customize your deck based on what kind of strategy you prefer and what kind of style you like is something that has always appealed to us, and trading card games are a fantastic outlet for that.

In fact, we love trading card games so much that we always thought it would be very cool to make our own cards. Unfortunately, that's not an option in most games; after all, how can you allow players to make their own cards and prevent them from playing low-cost cards that just say "you win the game when this spell is cast"?

Well, we found a way to make this dream a reality in this game, Keeper of the Cards. Here's how: instead of making effects, powers, and costs of cards arbitrary, as they are in most trading card games, Keeper of the Cards defines a set of rules for how all cards are to be constructed, and what it should cost to play them. So it's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle; you have a set number of "pieces" to choose from, but you can configure them basically in any way you want to create virtually any kind of card within those limitations.

But what good is that if the game is no good? That's why Keeper of the Cards is also designed to be a very fun game, incorporating ideas from several other trading card games. Its particular influences are the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game and the Duel Masters Trading Card Game, plus a small amount of influence from another libre trading card game, Arcmage. In short, the rules are designed to minimize luck-based victories, keep the rules relatively simple, and create an engaging, dynamic, and tense play experience.


# About This Set

This directory contains the Keeper of the Cards starter set, designed to get you started playing Keeper of the Cards!

Rules for the game can be found in this directory as "rules.pdf". If you do not see a "rules.pdf" file, please ensure you have downloaded the file labeled as "Starter Set" and not "Source Code". The latest starter set can be found under the [releases page](https://github.com/kotc-game/kotc/releases).

For creating cards, a card building guide ("card_building_guide.pdf") and a card template ("card.xcf") are also included. The template can be opened and edited with the GNU Image Manipulation Program or any other graphics software that supports the XCF format.

To start playing, a collection of example cards are included. Source XCF files are found in the "cards" folder. PNG exports can be found in the "cards-png" folder; these exports are made with a significant border around the edges, which is helpful if you use card printing services.

You will also find a collection of tip cards here; tip cards contain small, easily digestible snippets of the game's rules. You can give these to new players to help teach the game and to use as a quick reference for rules whose specific details are very important. Their source XCF files are found in the "tip_cards" folder and PNG exports (sized the same way as normal cards) are found in the "tip_cards-png" folder.

For printing cards yourself (both regular cards and tip cards), sets of cards laid out on sheets are available in the "sets" folder. This same folder also has a card backs set which you can use to print the reverse side of a set of self-printed cards, if you wish. These are all provided in ODG format, which is supported by [LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and hopefully should be viewable in Microsoft Visio too. (They are not exported to PDF because doing so seems to mess up size and margins in our experience for reasons we don't understand.)
